# Internship Readiness Analyzer

This project is a GUI-based Internship Readiness Analyzer built using Python and Tkinter.

It evaluates a student's technical readiness for IT internships based on:

• Python skill level  
• SQL skill level  
• Problem-solving frequency  
• Number of completed projects  

The system provides:

✔ Readiness Score (%)  
✔ Strength Area  
✔ Improvement Suggestion  
✔ Learning Roadmap


## Objective
The goal of this project is to help students understand their current technical readiness for IT internships and guide them on what skills to improve.


## Features
• Skill Assessment Interface  
• Readiness Score Calculation  
• Strength Identification  
• Improvement Suggestions  
• Internship Preparation Roadmap  
• User-friendly GUI using Tkinter


## Technologies Used
• Python  
• Tkinter (GUI)  


## Project Structure
main.py → Home Screen  
home.py → Assessment & Roadmap Interface  
python_page.py → Python Strength Logic  
sql_page.py → SQL Strength Logic  
topic.py → Improvement Suggestion Logic  
README.md → Project Documentation


## How It Works
1. User selects skill levels in Python, SQL, and Problem Solving.
2. User enters number of projects completed.
3. System calculates internship readiness score.
4. Displays:
   • Readiness %
   • Strength
   • Area to Improve
5. User can also view the roadmap for improvement.


## Outcome
This project demonstrates:

• Decision-based evaluation  
• GUI design skills  
• Real-world internship preparation logic
